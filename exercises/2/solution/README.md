# Running the Solution

You're going to need ruby. You might already have it! Try `which ruby` to check if you do. You'll probably need a version greater than 2.0.

You can find out how to do this by visiting the official Ruby site [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

After this install RSpec.

`gem install rspec`

If you're using a system version of ruby, this command may need to be prefixed by sudo.

Run the test with the following command:

`rspec liquid_parser_spec.rb`

You shouldn't get any failures!
